# Project: Algorithm implementation and evaluation: Collaborative Filtering

### [Project Report](doc/Main.Rmd)

+ Project title: Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation
 
+ Project summary: In this project, I implement matrix factorization by focusing on alternating least square algorithms and KNN as post-processing, in which I try to evaluate how regularization will impact the prediction results. I will use RMSE results for both train and test dataset as the basis of our evaluation. The objective of  this project is to produce a prediction of users' movies preference based on the ratings given respective users. We will compare the performance between the following models: 
	+ **Model 1:** Alternating Least Squares (ALS) with Temporal Dynamics (TD) Regularization and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Post-processing
	+ **Model 2:** Alternating Least Squares (ALS) with K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Post-processing
	
+ The structure of the Main report is as follows:
	+ **Section 1:** Model 1 Steps and Output
	+ **Section 2:** Model 2 Steps and Output
	+ **Section 3:** Evaluation and Conclusion
