# Project title: Unsupervised learning to detect anomalies
### Conducted by: Tram Duong

### Project description: 

+ [Clustering with K-means] (https://github.com/tramduong/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Hospital%20Charges%20Fraud/Unspervised/K-means_Clustering.ipynb)

This report aims to detect outliers in hospital charges dataset by using K-mean clustering. In this project, the number of clusters are defined by using elbows and silhouette score method. 

+ [PCA and KNN] (https://github.com/tramduong/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Hospital%20Charges%20Fraud/Unspervised/PCA_KNN.ipynb)

This report aims to detect outliers in hospital charges dataset by using PCA based anomaly dectection and KNN based anomaly detection.
