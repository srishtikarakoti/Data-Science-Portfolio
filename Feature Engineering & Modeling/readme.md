# Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Conducted by Tram Duong

### Summary

This folder contains feature engineering and exploratory data analysis in different datasets. The purpose of FE and EDA here is to define critical outliers in a system. Based on the context, these outliers can be detrimental and result in loss of resources, and time through errors, fraud, manipulation of stocks, and other such malicious activities. Outliers can also be beneficial for example in investing, and arbitrage. By examining new approaches for developing new features, it helps to support machine learning algorithms and improve fraud detection and cost savings for business. 

The feature engineering strategies for each dataset providing different fraud detection frameworks that support the modeling approaches later on. 

### Project Description

+ [Credit Card FE&EDA](https://github.com/tramduong/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Feature%20Engineering%20%26%20Modeling/Doc/CreditCard_FE%26EDA.ipynb): Create multiple feature engineerings to support data exploration and data analysis regarding to credit card fraud detection. 
+ [Hospital Charge FE&EDA](https://github.com/tramduong/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Feature%20Engineering%20%26%20Modeling/Doc/HospitalCharge_FE%26EDA.ipynb): Create multiple feature engineerings to support data exploration and data analysis regarding to hospital charge fraud. 
+ [Loan Default FE&EDA + Modeling](https://github.com/tramduong/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Feature%20Engineering%20%26%20Modeling/Doc/Loandefault_GradientBoosting%26RF.ipynb): Create multiple feature engineerings to support data exploration and data analysis regarding to loan fraud. In this case, I also applied gradient boosting and random forest to detect anomalies. 
+ [Stock Trading Strategies](https://github.com/tramduong/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Feature%20Engineering%20%26%20Modeling/Doc/Stock_FE%26TradingStrategy.ipynb): Define trading strategies for different stock, using sharpe ratio,macd, oversold, overbought, and buy&hold.
